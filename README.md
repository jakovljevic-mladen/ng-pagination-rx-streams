# NgPaginationRxStreams

This project was build using Angular 10. It is meant to be used as the demo for auto pagination while scrolling feed items using almost entirely [RxJS](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs) Observable streams.
This project is mainly driven by the excellent [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-nFj2o03i8) by [Ben Lesh](https://github.com/benlesh) where he describes more advanced use of RxJS operators.
His example project can be found [here](https://github.com/benlesh/add-features-with-rxjs).

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
